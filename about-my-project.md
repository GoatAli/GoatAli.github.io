## About My Project

Exploring Trustworthy AI through chatbot development

Problem: There is plenty of bias and transparency concerns with chatbot development and because of this, users find difficulty in comprehending how AI systems make informed decisions. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in developing strategies to increase the transparency of AI decision-making processes that accomplishes the following:

  - Provide clear and concise explanations for answers provided by chatbots.
  - Using interpretable models to help users understand and trust the system.
  - Installing bias detection tools to help mitigate biases in training data and model outputs. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a successful PowerPoint presentation at the end of the CEAMLS program highlighting the insights we found in our research.
