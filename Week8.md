For this week, my team and I completed our corpus, created an agent called trustbot through our three different frameworks, and 
added intents, utterances, and responses to the trustbot. The information we gathered was from our literature reviews, all the responses we 
added was from our literature review articles. We sat down as a team and discussed our findings to ensure that they matched the information 
from our literature reviews.
