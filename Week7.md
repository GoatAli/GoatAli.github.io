This week, my group and I presented what we have done so far this summer at the mid-summer symposium. We also had to create a corpus where we 
listed our definitions for trustworthy AI and other AI related concepts. We came together as a group to discuss the definitions for each term we 
had in our corpus. We were also tasked with updating our curriculum slides to include all the features of each of our frameworks.
