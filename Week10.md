This week, me and my team finished our PowerPoint for the final symposium. We also spent time practicing for the symposium along with creating
our demo videos. Also spent time completing our technical paper and ensuring that we had the proper information to use as references for our
citations. We delivered a successful PowerPoint presentation at the final symposium.
