For this week, I had to update my chatbot on dialogflow with more intents and different question hydrants for each intent. I had to come up with different ways of asking the question, for example, if my question was "What is trustworthy AI?" another way of asking that would be "Trustworthy AI?" or "What makes AI trustworthy?" I also had to conduct a powerpoint slide of my literature review where I read three literature articles that talked about trustworthy AI and how to implement AI in education. I was also tasked with creating different webpages for figma and my social media topic was Disney+.
