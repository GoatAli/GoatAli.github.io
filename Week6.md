This week, my team and I were tasked with completing our PowerPoint slides for the mid summer symposium. Our PowerPoint slides were about what 
we had done in our group so far. In the slides, we had to include information about how we created and trained our chatbots on trustworthy AI 
using four different low-code frameworks along with relevant information we gathered from our literature reviews. Despite the symposium being 
canceled, we still had to ensure that our slides were completed and practice our presenting skills.
