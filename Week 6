This week, my group and I were tasked with completing our PowerPoint slides for the mid summer symposium. Our PowerPoint slides were about how we built our chatbots using 
four different low code frameworks along with information we gathered from all of our literature reviews. Even though the symposium was canceled, we still had to 
work on our slides and practice our presenting skills.
